AI has been impacting our life nowadays, from image classification to ChatGPT, the evolution is very fast! Most of the AI models are implemented by using deep learning technique, which is using a huge amount of data to train the model to get better results for prediction.

Large deep learning model is very complex, but small model is relatively understandable and can do a lot of things, like image classification, sales forecasting, recommendation etc.

The basic idea of deep learning is consisted by perceptions, which calculate from the input data to a prediction output. For instance, 0.3 is a probability of an image of a cat.

To simpify, we can create a preception with 2 inputs and 1 output, and it can form an equation as $f(x) = w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + b = 0.$
